# TODO

* Select fonts randomly
* If comment includes english chars, don't use certain fonts
* Map line-height to font
* Calculate "proximity" by going over all user's posts and seeing who likes/comments the most
* Animate "strong" word selection (go over some words then focus on the strong one)
* If there are a lot exclamation marks, start increasing the icon
* If there are a lot of repeating charecters (3 or more), start duplicating the icon
* Use new backgrounds
* Per each icon use an exclude background list

* Find out how I set the port properly
